# Misc fandom scripts

I was having trouble finding things I made, so I've decided to organize them here. Contributions are welcome! I'm also open to splitting things out into a new repo if that seems like it would make more sense.

Links to available scripts/descriptions/installation instructions:

1. [Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey scripts](tampermonkey/)
2. [AO3 site skins](ao3-site-skins/)
